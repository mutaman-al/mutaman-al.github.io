        <h1>ChatUM</h1>
        <p>ChatUM (pronounced Chat'em) was a social media website created in coordination with others to allow for
            student communication during COVID-19. At the time, classes were remote so students did not have many
            avenues to socialize. This social media platform provided the ability to create accounts, posts, and
            comments that were customizable to each student and class. Additionally, cross-class socialization was
            supported by allowing students to create a main page for their feed so they can see posts from several
            classes at once.</p>
        <p>Created using React, Firebase, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.</p>
